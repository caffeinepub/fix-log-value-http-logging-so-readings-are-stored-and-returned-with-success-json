  "summary": "Implemented a new runtime configuration resolver with a fallback chain (build-time env → window global → sessionStorage cache → /env.json) and updated HttpLoggingInstructionsCard to use it with improved English error messaging and a hard refresh action. Added a static public env.json and a hint in index.html for injecting window.CANISTER_ID_BACKEND. However, the diff does not demonstrate that the production build/redeploy will expose the *correct deployed* backend canister ID (env.json currently contains an empty value).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the production build/redeploy correctly embeds or exposes the deployed backend canister ID to the frontend at runtime (matching the actually deployed production backend canister), and if /env.json remains used, it should return 200 with the expected backend canister ID content.",
      "reason": "The added frontend/public/env.json exists but sets \"CANISTER_ID_BACKEND\" to an empty string, and there is no evidence in the diff of injecting or embedding the real deployed production canister ID into the production artifact/runtime configuration.",
      "evidence": [
