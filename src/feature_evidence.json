Implement a robust fallback chain that prefers build-time values (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_CANISTER_ID_BACKEND` / `import.meta.env.CANISTER_ID_BACKEND`) and optional `window.CANISTER_ID_BACKEND`, and only uses `/env.json` when available; the app must not end up in a state where `CANISTER_ID_BACKEND is not set` solely because `/env.json` is unavailable.",
